Welcome to the installation of NewsOffice

Installation instructions:
Upload the NewsOffice directory itself, and not just the files in it, from the installation package onto your webhost. You can use a FTP client, like FileZilla, to do this or your webhosts on file system browser.

Then visit the URL in which the NewsOffice files are located. For example: http://www.yourwebsite.com/newsoffice/
Then you will get an installation wizard of a few small steps, follow those instructions.

In the system status step you will get a list of files which need to be CHMOD-ed. CHMOD 777 on these files is required because else NewsOffice will not be able to write your news posts to it's core files.
